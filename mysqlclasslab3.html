show databases;

# select a database

# view the tables for the selected database
show tables;

# show base tables and views labeled
show full tables;

# view the structure of the tables

# unary operations-

# show the contents of the tables using Selection with a predicate sorted by an attribute
select * from employees where gender= 'M' order by last_name;
select * from departments where dept_name = 'Sales';


# show the contents of the tables using Projection
select first_name, last_name, birth_date from employees;

# multi table queries using the WHERE clause to join on the primary key=foreign key using table aliases when there is an ambiguity in attribute names

# BEFORE running this statement insert the syntax that joins the tables

# Joins-

# theta join- queries using operators other than =

# multi table query with the JOIN ON command- select attributes from table1 and table2  join on (PK=FK)

# construct the query to answer the question- make sure to add the necessary syntax that joins the tables-use the WHERE or JOIN USING or JOIN ON commands

# display the employees that have a title of Engineer and how long they have had the title, sort by emp_no and from_date

select first_name, last_name, from_date, to_date, title
    from employees

# display the employees that have a title of Engineer and how long they have had the title and their salary record, sort by emp_no and salary in descending order - remember to qualify ambiguous attributes

select first_name, last_name, from_date, to_date, title, salary
    from employees


# display the employees who have managed the Marketing department

select first_name, last_name, from_date, to_date
    from employees

# display the employees who have managed the Marketing department and their title(s),sort by emp_no -remember to qualify ambiguous attributes

select first_name, last_name, title, from_date, to_date
    from employees


# outer join- query results include records that do not have a match on the related table(s)

# sample syntax with JOIN ON-

# displays all the records from table1 that do not have a match in table2- select attributes from table 1 left join table2 on (pk=fk)- where the left table is the first one in the from statement

# displays all the records from table2 that do not have a match in table1- select attributes from table 1 right join table2 on (pk=fk)- where the right table is the second in the join statement

# displays all the records from both tables with or without a match- select attributes from table 1 full join table2 on (pk=fk)

select first_name, last_name
    from employees e
    right join dept_manager m on (e.emp_no=m.emp_no);
